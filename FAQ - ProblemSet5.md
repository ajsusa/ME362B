# Frequently Asked Questions: Problem Set 5

__1. How do I save my work in _Binder_?__

a. As a Jupyter notebook to continue working on later:
Use _File > Download as > Notebook (.ipynb)_ to save a copy of your modified notebook in its current state.

b. As a PDF for submission: 
Use _File > Print Preview_, then _Print_ the preview as a .PDF file.

__2. How do I load my work to continue working?__

Open a _Binder_ session and navigate to the repository view:

* Option 1: Click here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/ajsusa-me362b_winter2021-9zsw8kh4/tree/notebooks)
* Option 2: Use the _Launch Binder_ link from the Problem Set assignment to open the problem set 5 template, then click _File > Open_

__3. Can I run my notebook locally on my local computer, instead of through _Binder_?__

Yes you can, but for the sake of this assignment, it's not recommended or worth the effort.

To run your notebook on your local computer, you would need:

* Python 3 installed
* A Python interpretter configured with Cantera, numpy, matplotlib, jupyter, and ipykernel installed
* Your interpretter registered as Jupyter kernel
* Resetting the notebook kernel for your assignment to your local interpretter

None of this is particularly difficult, but it introduced a good bit of extra time, a number of extra steps,
and the need to install software that can all be avoided by using the preconfigured _Binder_ environment.
